# Overview

I wrote a small game in Unity that plays with the physics capabilities of the engine. 

My purpose in writing this was to become familiar with modern 3D game engines and to have a little fun.

To play the game, you can move with any stanard Unity movement input (WASD, arrow keys, controller joystick) and click the orange cube
to spawn a random colored sphere that rolls down the ramp in front of you, or press the red cube to spawn 1,000 random colored wheres.

# Development Environment

I used Unity game engine for the bulk of the editing, and Visual Studio 2022 for the C# script editing.

# Useful Websites

There were a handful of useful tutorials to set this up. I watched YouTube videos.
* [YouTube: Using Unity Instantiate()](https://youtu.be/E7gmylDS1C4)
* [YouTube: Excellent tutorial for getting started](https://youtu.be/XDAYS-qYe6Y)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Be able to rotate the camera.
* Have jumping physics (not flying)
* Reset when you go off the edge.
